    "content": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from data. It involves training algorithms on large datasets to recognize patterns and make predictions. There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models. Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data. Reinforcement learning learns through trial and error by receiving rewards or penalties."

It supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. Popular libraries include NumPy for numerical computing, Pandas for data analysis, and Django for web development. Python is widely used in data science, machine learning, web development, and automation."
